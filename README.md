## 🔥 **Why I’m Doing This**

I originally learned Python years ago, but after a long break, I forgot a lot of it. Now, I’m relearning everything **systematically**, improving my skills, and documenting my journey. This repository serves as my **digital notebook** and a resource for anyone on a similar path! 🚀
