- Pygame is a directory of Python modules designed for writing games.

- When `pygame` is imported, the `__init__.py` file is executed as part of the import process, and everything defined within it is loaded into the `pygame` namespace.

- `__init__.py` not only contains its own functionalities but also imports other modules in the `pygame` package, making them accessible as attributes of the `pygame` namespace.

- `pygame.init()` is a function defined in the `__init__.py` file that initializes all Pygame modules which require initialization (by calling their individual `init() `functions).

- A helper function is a function that performs part of the computation of another function; a single leading underscore before a method name indicates a helper method.

- Refactoring code with helper functions improve its structure, design, and implementation while maintaining its original functionality.
